# Note Taker

## Description
This application is the week 11 project of the edX/Monash bootcamp with a focus on X.  The task was to build an SVG based off user input from the terminal using the Inquirer module.  I personally liked this method of coding, as it kept everything organised and reusable.  As for testing the application, I used the jest module.  During the week when we were learning to use jest, I was fairly confused for why we were using it, but after I took some time to read over it and understand the syntax, it all made sense and I was able to feature it into my application without any troubles!

The acceptance criteria of this project were as follows:
