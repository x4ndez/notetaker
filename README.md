# Note Taker

![Screenshot of application](./screenshot.gif)

## Description
This application is the week 11 project of the edX/Monash bootcamp with a focus on express.js.  The task was to build a note taking app that utilises GET, POST and DELETE HTTP methods.  I used modular routing and made a folder system to keep things a little more organised instead of putting all routes in the same folder.  I also used in-built middleware and hope to add my own custom middleware to console log different HTTP events.  I got good experience using Insomnia, through testing all my API calls, and using it to troubleshoot at some points.  I had some fun making a 9-digit ID creator function, which I was happy that I could use the array filter method because I'd just spent an hour using it and pulling my hair out over AlgoExpert challenges.  Although I used arrays for this function, I probably didn't need to... but arrays are king.

The acceptance criteria of this project were as follows:

```md
GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
```
